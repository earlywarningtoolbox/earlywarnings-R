# earlywarnings-R

This repository contains the development version of the Early Warning
Signals for Critical Transitions CRAN R package. For installation and
usage examples, see the [vignette](vignettes/vignette.Rmd). The main
authors are Vasilis Dakos and Leo Lahti.

The Early-Warning-Signals Toolbox provides methods for estimating
statistical changes in timeseries that can be used for identifying
nearby critical transitions. The project is based on Dakos and others
(2012) Methods for Detecting Early Warnings of Critical Transitions in
Time Series Illustrated Using Simulated Ecological Data. PLOS ONE
7(7):e41010 with contributions from S.R.  Carpenter, T. Cline.
