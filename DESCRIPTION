Description: The Early-Warning-Signals Toolbox provides methods for estimating
    statistical changes in timeseries that can be used for identifying nearby
    critical transitions. Based on Dakos et al (2012) Methods for Detecting
    Early Warnings of Critical Transitions in Time Series Illustrated Using
    Simulated Ecological Data. PLoS ONE 7(7):e41010 with contributions from S.R.
    Carpenter, T. Cline.
